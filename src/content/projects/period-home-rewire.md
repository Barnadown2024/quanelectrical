A full rewire of a period property in Thomastown, including a new consumer unit, rewiring of both floors, and preparation for a new kitchen and bathroom. We worked around the existing layout where possible and used minimal chase work to protect the character of the building. All work is certified and the client now has USB sockets, improved lighting circuits, and RCD protection throughout.
