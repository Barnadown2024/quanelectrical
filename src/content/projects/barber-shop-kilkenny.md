We completed a full rewire and consumer unit upgrade for a busy barber shop on High Street. The existing installation was outdated and couldn’t support the new chair motors, lighting, and music system. We ran new circuits, installed a modern consumer unit with RCD protection, and added dedicated circuits for the back-room equipment. The job was completed over a weekend to minimise disruption. The client now has a fully certified installation and peace of mind for insurance and safety.
