We installed a 22 kW three-phase EV charging point at a working farm near Castlecomer. The supply was already three-phase, so we added a dedicated circuit from the main distribution board, installed the charger on a sturdy post near the yard, and supported the client with the SEAI grant application. The installation is certified and ready for current and future vehicles.
