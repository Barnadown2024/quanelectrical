Thinking about a home EV charger? Here’s what to consider before you book an installation.

**1. Single-phase vs three-phase**  
Most Irish homes have single-phase supply. For many EVs a 7 kW single-phase charger is enough for overnight charging. If you have (or can get) three-phase supply, a 22 kW charger will charge faster — useful if you do high mileage or have more than one EV.

**2. Cable run**  
The distance from your fuse board to where you want the charger affects cost. We’ll check this at the survey and quote accordingly.

**3. SEAI grant**  
The SEAI grant can significantly reduce the cost. We’re an approved installer and can guide you through the application.

**4. Smart features**  
Many chargers offer app control, scheduling, and integration with solar or night-rate tariffs. We can recommend models to suit your setup.
