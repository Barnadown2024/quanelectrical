Older homes often have wiring that doesn’t meet current standards and may not have RCD protection. Here are signs it might be time for a rewire or upgrade.

- **Fuse board** — If you still have an old fuse box with wire fuses (or no RCDs), an upgrade is recommended for safety.
- **Flickering or tripping** — Lights flickering or circuits tripping regularly can indicate overloaded or faulty wiring.
- **Two-prong sockets** — Old round-pin or two-prong sockets suggest very old wiring that may need replacement.
- **Planned renovation** — If you’re extending or refurbishing, it’s a good time to rewire so everything is compliant and future-proof.
