Older fuse boards often lack the RCD protection required by current regulations. We upgrade consumer units (fuse boards) to modern standards, improving safety and meeting compliance for insurance, sales, and rentals.

- Consumer unit replacement
- RCD and RCBO protection
- Full testing and certification
- Minimal disruption
- Compliance certificates

We'll assess your current board and provide a clear quote. Upgrades are typically completed in a single visit. Contact us for a free assessment.
